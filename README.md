Find the job
-------------
Upon choosing to either log in or continue as a guest user, a user is presented with a zoomed out map with a menu where they can apply desired geofilters for occupation, location, and cost of living. These filters can be set in various ways:
Cost of living can be set with a slider to indicate an upper and lower bound in order to accommodate a range of dollar per month amounts. Alternatively, text fields are available for input next to the slider.
Jobs can be typed in a text field or selected from a list arranged in categorical hierarchy, allowing to search for either a specific job or a general type of job.
Location can be typed in a text field accompanied by travel radius, or selected directly on the map with a point-and-click interface to designate general location.
If the user attempts to search without an applied filter, the interface prompts the user to apply at least one filter. After selecting all available filters or only one filter, the map displays relevant locations and zooms in to fit all areas. For example, if the user inputs Texas, the map fits all relevant areas within the state of Texas. Cost of living is displayed as a heat map with a key indicating dollar/month values, and job listings are shown as points on the map. Clicking on a point pops out a small window containing information about the cost of living at the location of the point  and information about the job listing. Clicking on hypertext within the window takes the user to the LinkedIn page for the job listing.

Save Search Result
-------------------
After searching, a logged in user can choose his or her ideal job from the search results. Each job listing has two buttons. Clicking the first one allows the user to view the job details and related information. Clicking the second button allows the user to save the job to his or her favorites list. Users can also add notes to each saved job and filter the list by attributes, such as location or job type.
