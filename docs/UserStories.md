## Finding a Job
Upon choosing to either log in or continue as a guest user, a user is presented with a zoomed out map with a menu where they can apply desired geofilters for occupation and occupation.
There are two search fields for job and location.
After inputing a search, the map displays relevant locations and zooms in to fit all areas.
For example, if the user search for cleaning jobs in Texas, the map fits all relevant areas within the state of Texas.
Cost of living is displayed as a heat map and job listings are shown as points on the map.
Clicking on a point pops out a small window containing information about the job listing.
The user can save the job for later by clicking the "Save" checkbox.

## Save Search Result
After searching, a logged in user can choose his or her ideal job from the search results. Each job listing has two buttons. Clicking the first one allows the user to view the job details and related information. Clicking the second button allows the user to save the job to his or her favorites list. Users can also add notes to each saved job and filter the list by attributes, such as location or job type.
